"""FastAPI wrapper around the ADK agent.

ADK ships ``adk web`` and ``adk run`` for interactive dev, but for the
deployed Render service we want a clean HTTP surface the mobile coach
can call. This module exposes:

    POST /chat      — single-turn input → final text response
    GET  /healthz   — readiness check (200 + JSON if the agent imported
                      cleanly + MongoDB is reachable)
    GET  /          — returns a tiny JSON banner so the Render free-tier
                      cold-start hit shows up in logs

Sessions are kept in-memory (``InMemorySessionService``) so the first
deploy boots without an external session store. For multi-instance
production you'd swap to ``DatabaseSessionService`` against the same
MongoDB.
